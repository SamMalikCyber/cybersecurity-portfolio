# Use Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions

This project highlights how I used Linux commands to check, understand, and update file and directory permissions to match security requirements. I walked through each step of checking existing permissions, spotting anything that didn’t look right, and then making changes so only the right people had the right access. Since identity and access management is an area I’m especially interested in, I made sure to approach each change carefully so the results followed security best practices.

## Scenario
You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
