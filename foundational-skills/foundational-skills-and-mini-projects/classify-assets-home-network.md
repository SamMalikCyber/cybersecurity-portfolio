# Classify Assets on My Home Network

**Skills Demonstrated:** Asset inventory creation, sensitivity classification, security prioritization, risk awareness.

In this mini project, I created an inventory of devices connected to my home network and classified each one based on sensitivity. Asset classification helps identify which devices need stronger protections and how they should be handled. While I personally treat **all** my devices as if they were highly sensitive, this table reflects realistic usage and access levels across my household.

### Summary
By classifying my home network assets, I identified which devices store sensitive data, which are shared openly, and which require the highest level of security. While I personally maintain strict security practices on my own devices, because you know, the field that im interested in, classifying assets by their **actual risk profile** helps prioritize protections and monitoring. This process is essential in both home and enterprise environments to reduce attack surfaces and ensure proper safeguards are applied. One of the most fun projects that I've worked on!
