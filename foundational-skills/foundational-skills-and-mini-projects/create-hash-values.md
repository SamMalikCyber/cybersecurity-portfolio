# Create Hash Values

## Project Description
In this mini project, I used Linux commands to display file contents, generate SHA-256 hash values, save them to files, and compare them. This demonstrates file integrity verification.

## Tools Used
- `ls`
- `cat`
- `sha256sum`
- `cmp`

---

## Commands Practiced & Outputs
```bash
$ ls
# Output:
file1.txt  file2.txt

$ cat file1.txt
# Output:
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

$ cat file2.txt
# Output:
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*

$ sha256sum file1.txt
# Output:
131f95c51cc819465fa1797f6ccacf9d494aaaff46fa3eac73ae63ffbdfd8267  file1.txt

$ sha256sum file2.txt
# Output:
2558ba9a4cad1e69804ce03aa2a029526179a91a5e38cb723320e83af9ca017b  file2.txt

$ sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash
$ sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash

$ cat file1hash
# Output:
131f95c51cc819465fa1797f6ccacf9d494aaaff46fa3eac73ae63ffbdfd8267  file1.txt

$ cat file2hash
# Output:
2558ba9a4cad1e69804ce03aa2a029526179a91a5e38cb723320e83af9ca017b  file2.txt

$ cmp file1hash file2hash
# Output:
file1hash file2hash differ: char 1, line 1
```

## Summary

In this mini project, I checked whether two files were identical by generating their SHA-256 hash values and comparing them. Even though both files looked the same when viewed with cat, their hashes were different, which confirmed that the files were not identical. I saved each hash to its own file, then used cmp to pinpoint the exact difference. This reinforced how hashing can reveal changes in files that arenâ€™t obvious by inspection and showed how to verify file integrity with simple Linux commands.
