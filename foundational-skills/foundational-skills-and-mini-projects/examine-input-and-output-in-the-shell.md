# Examine Input and Output in the Shell

This mini project demonstrates how I used basic Bash commands to generate output, perform simple calculations, and clear the terminal â€” simple but essential shell skills.

---

### Tools Used
- Bash shell (Debian-based Linux VM)

---

### Commands Practiced and Their Output
```bash
# Output simple text
echo hello
```
**Returns:**
```
hello
```

```bash
# Output text with quotes
echo "hello"
```
**Returns:**
```
hello
```

```bash
# Output a name
echo "Your Name"
```
**Returns:**
```
Your Name
```

```bash
# Subtraction with expr
expr 32 - 8
```
**Returns:**
```
24
```

```bash
# Multiplication with expr
expr 3500 \* 12
```
**Returns:**
```
42000
```

```bash
# Clear the terminal
clear
```
**Effect:** Clears all previous output from the terminal window.

### Summary
This task helped reinforce basic command line concepts such as using echo for output, expr for calculations, and clear for screen management. Practicing these foundational skills and being comfortable with these simple commands is an important foundation to help build confidence and efficiency when with the command line, which is important in our everyday security tasks.
