# Conduct a Vulnerability Assessment

In this project, I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a fictional e-commerce company using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 as a guide. I focused on a remote database server that had been left publicly accessible since launch, identified risks, created a simple risk register with likelihood and impact scores, and outlined remediation strategies. This gave me practice in structuring a clear report, explaining risks in business terms, and prioritizing fixes.

## Scenario
You’re a newly hired cybersecurity analyst at an e-commerce company. The company’s remote database server is open to the public so distributed employees can query it from anywhere. While convenient, this setup poses a serious vulnerability.

Your task was to assess the system, explain why it’s risky, and recommend steps to secure the server while keeping the business running.

## Approach
I approached this situation by evaluating the exposed database server, mapping potential threat sources and events, and applying NIST’s scoring system to communicate risk levels to decision makers. This was also one of the most challenging and fun projects I worked on, and it pushed me to think critically and creatively about how to evaluate risks in a very structured way.

- Reviewed the system description and scope (public database server)  
- Identified key threat sources and possible attack events  
- Used likelihood and impact scoring to create a risk register  
- Outlined practical remediation strategies to secure the system
