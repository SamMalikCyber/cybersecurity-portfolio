# Conduct a Vulnerability Assessment

In this project, I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a fictional e-commerce company using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 as a guide. I focused on a remote database server that had been left publicly accessible since launch, identified risks, created a simple risk register with likelihood and impact scores, and outlined remediation strategies. This gave me practice in structuring a clear report, explaining risks in business terms, and prioritizing fixes.

## Scenario
You’re a newly hired cybersecurity analyst at an e-commerce company. The company’s remote database server is open to the public so distributed employees can query it from anywhere. While convenient, this setup poses a serious vulnerability.

Your task was to assess the system, explain why it’s risky, and recommend steps to secure the server while keeping the business running.

## Approach
I approached this situation by evaluating the exposed database server, mapping potential threat sources and events, and applying NIST’s scoring system to communicate risk levels to decision makers.

- Reviewed the system description and scope (public database server)  
- Identified key threat sources and possible attack events  
- Used likelihood and impact scoring to create a risk register  
- Outlined practical remediation strategies to secure the system
