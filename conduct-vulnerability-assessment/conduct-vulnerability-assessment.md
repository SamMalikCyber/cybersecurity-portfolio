# Conduct a Vulnerability Assessment

## Purpose
The purpose of this assessment was to evaluate the security risks of a publicly accessible database server at a fictional e-commerce company and to create a remediation plan based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.

---

## System Description and Scope
- The company relies on a **remote database server** to store customer, campaign, and analytics data.  
- Employees worldwide query the database daily to find potential customers.  
- The server has been **open to the public since the company’s launch three years ago**.  
- This assessment focused on risks to the database server and the data it contains.  

---

## Approach
My approach focused on reviewing the system setup, identifying realistic threats, scoring risks with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, and recommending the most practical fixes.

- Reviewed the system description and scope, focusing on the remote public database server  
- Identified realistic threat sources and events such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and SQL injection  
- Used a 1–3 likelihood and impact scale to calculate risk scores and populate a risk register  
- Prioritized the most severe risks (data exposure and unauthorized access) for remediation  
- Developed mitigation strategies that balanced business operations with stronger controls

## Risk Register

| Threat Source / Event                          | Likelihood (1–3) | Impact (1–3) | Risk Score |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| Unauthorized public access to database         | 3                | 3            | 9          |
| Data exfiltration of customer/analytics data   | 3                | 3            | 9          |
| SQL injection attack on exposed database       | 2                | 3            | 6          |
| Denial of service against public server        | 2                | 2            | 4          |
| Insider misuse of open access                  | 2                | 2            | 4          |

---

## Issues Found
- **Public database server** had no access restrictions, leaving it exposed to anyone on the internet.  
- **Customer and campaign data** stored on the database could be stolen, modified, or destroyed.  
- **No auditing or monitoring** in place to detect unauthorized access attempts.  

---

## Recommendations
1. **Restrict database access** to employees only (VPN, IP allowlisting, or private network segmentation).  
2. **Implement authentication and authorization** for all database queries.  
3. **Enable logging and monitoring** for unusual query patterns and unauthorized attempts.  
4. **Harden the database server** against SQL injection by validating inputs and applying least privilege to database accounts.  
5. **Conduct regular vulnerability scans** and penetration tests on critical systems.

## Conclusion
This vulnerability assessment demonstrated how leaving critical systems open to the public creates significant risk for an e-commerce business. By applying NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, I identified the highest-priority threats, scored their likelihood and impact, and created a risk register. The recommended mitigations of restricting access, enabling authentication, monitoring, and hardening the system would significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and service disruption.
