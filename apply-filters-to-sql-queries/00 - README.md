# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

In this project, I practiced using SQL filters to pull very specific information from two different tables, `log_in_attempts` and `employees`. I worked with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators to narrow results, and also used `LIKE` with wildcards for pattern matching. These queries helped me locate failed login attempts after hours, find suspicious login activity by date and location, and identify which employee machines needed security updates. This kind of filtering is a key step when investigating incidents or preparing for minor or major system changes.

## Scenario
You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
