# Network Traffic Analysis & Incident Response

This project is a hands-on exercise in analyzing suspicious DNS and ICMP traffic using a basic network analysis tool (tcpdump). The goal was to simulate an early-stage incident response investigation and figure out why users couldnâ€™t access a company website.

Using packet data, I identified that UDP traffic to port 53 (DNS) was failing and returning ICMP error messages, pointing to a possible DNS server issue. I outlined potential causes such as a misconfiguration or denial-of-service attack, and proposed next steps to resolve the incident.

I combined technical tools with clear thinking and communication to provide necessary steps in protecting my organization.
