## Recommendations

The following recommendations summarize the key areas Botium Toys should address to improve its security posture.

To improve Botium Toys’ overall security posture, several key security controls should be prioritized. These include implementing stronger password policies, enforcing separation of duties and least privilege, establishing a disaster recovery plan, and deploying intrusion detection systems and encryption. Additionally, maintaining and managing legacy systems is necessary to reduce potential vulnerabilities.

There are multiple gaps from the compliance perspective, and addressing asset classification and data handling procedures will help support adherence to PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC requirements. Properly classifying assets will also help identify further security needs and ensure that sensitive information remains protected.
