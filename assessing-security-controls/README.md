# Assessing Security Controls and Compliance Gaps

This project involved reviewing a security risk assessment report for a fictional company, Botium Toys.  
The goal was to identify which security controls were implemented, which were missing, and assess compliance gaps with industry standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.  

The project showcases my ability to understand security frameworks, analyze risk reports, and provide actionable recommendations to improve security posture.

This is part of my cybersecurity portfolio demonstrating practical skills and knowledge.
