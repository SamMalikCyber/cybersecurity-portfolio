# Assessing Security Controls and Compliance Gaps

This project showcases my ability to evaluate security controls and compliance requirements for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**.

I reviewed whether key security controls were in place, such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems, then checked compliance against PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC frameworks. Finally, I provided practical recommendations to improve the companyâ€™s security posture and reduce risks.
