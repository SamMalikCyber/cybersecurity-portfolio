# Assessing Security Controls and Compliance Gaps

This project showcases my ability to evaluate security controls and compliance requirements for a fictional company, **Botium Toys**.

I reviewed whether key security controls were in place, such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems, then checked compliance against PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC frameworks. Finally, I provided practical recommendations to improve the company’s security posture and reduce risks.

## Project Scenario

This scenario is based on a fictional company:

**Botium Toys** is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, storefront, and warehouse. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their IT department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide.

The IT manager has decided to conduct an internal audit to help secure the company’s infrastructure and ensure compliance as the company grows. She is particularly focused on online payment processing and doing business in the European Union (E.U.).

The manager began implementing the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, defined the audit’s scope and goals, listed current IT assets, and completed a basic risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets and estimate possible compliance fines or operational risks.

Your task was to review this information and complete a **controls and compliance checklist** to support the audit.
