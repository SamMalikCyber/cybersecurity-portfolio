# Score Risks Based on Likelihood and Severity

## Project Description
This project is about evaluating potential risks for a fictional commercial bank and figuring out which ones deserve the most attention. I scored each risk on how likely it is to happen and how bad it would be if it did. Then I multiplied those scores to get a final risk score, which makes it easier to prioritize what to tackle first. This kind of thinking is important because not all risks are equal, some can cause way more trouble than others to my company.

## Risk Register

| Risk Description | Likelihood (1–3) | Impact (1–3) | Risk Score |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Leak of financial records** – Sensitive financial data like account balances or transaction histories is exposed. | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| **Compromised customer database** – Personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and SSNs is stolen. | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| **Supply chain disruption** – Critical vendor services go down, halting normal bank operations. | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| **Phishing attack on employees** – Staff receive malicious emails leading to credential theft. | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| **Ransomware infection** – Malware encrypts key systems, demanding payment for release. | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| **Insider data theft** – Employee steals or leaks internal documents or customer info. | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| **DDoS attack on banking website** – Online banking services become unavailable to customers. | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| **Malware infection on ATMs** – Localized ATM outages due to malicious software. | 1 | 2 | 2 |

## How I Scored the Risks
- **Likelihood** was scored from **1 (low chance)** to **3 (high chance)** based on how often I think it could realistically happen in a bank’s environment.
- **Impact** was scored from **1 (low impact)** to **3 (critical impact)** based on how much damage it could cause to operations, customers, or reputation.
- **Risk Score** was calculated by multiplying *Likelihood × Impact*.

## Summary
I practiced scoring different risks so I could see how to **prioritize** which issues need attention first. For example, financial record leaks, compromised databases, and supply chain disruptions all scored **9**, which makes them the highest priority. Other issues like phishing and ransomware were still serious but slightly lower in urgency. This exercise made it clear that not everything can be handled at once, and knowing what matters most helps focus resources where they have the biggest impact. This was another project I really enjoyed working on.
