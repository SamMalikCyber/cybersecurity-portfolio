# Score Risks Based on Their Likelihood and Severity

In this project, I practiced doing a basic risk assessment for a fictional commercial bank. I reviewed different potential risks, considered how likely each one might be, and how serious the impact could be if it happened. Using a simple 1â€“3 scale for both likelihood and impact, I calculated risk scores to help prioritize which issues should be addressed first. This was a good hands-on way to work with a risk register and think about how to focus on the risks that matter most instead of getting stuck on less important ones.


## Skills Demonstrated
- Risk assessment and scoring
- Evaluating likelihood and impact
- Prioritizing threats using a risk register
- Applying asset and operational context to scoring decisions

## Scenario
You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A risk register is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.
