# Network Hardening Risk Assessment Report

## Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods

To reduce the chances of another breach, I’ve focused on three specific practices that will help strengthen the organization’s overall security posture:

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
- **Password policy implementation and enforcement**  
- **Firewall configuration and upkeep**

**MFA** is one of the most effective ways to reduce unauthorized access. Even if a password is shared or stolen, it adds a second layer of protection that makes it much harder for outsiders to get in.

A strong **password policy** goes hand-in-hand with MFA. By requiring longer passwords, using a mix of characters and special symbols, and enforcing limits on login attempts, we make brute-force attacks and password sharing much less effective.

**Firewall maintenance** often gets overlooked, but it plays a key role in keeping threats out. Rules need to be reviewed and updated regularly, especially after any security incident to make sure nothing is left exposed.

## Part 2: Explanation and Reasoning

Implementing MFA would immediately help prevent incidents like the one this company experienced. If someone gets access to a weak or shared password, MFA ensures that’s not enough to break in. It also helps reduce risks from casual password sharing between coworkers.

A well-written and enforced password policy will help prevent the initial vulnerability from happening again. Stronger credentials and account lockout policies shrink the window of opportunity for attackers.

Improving firewall rules and monitoring gives the company more control over what enters or leaves the network. If we set clear boundaries and keep them updated, it becomes much harder for attackers to slip through unnoticed.

These steps taken together aren’t just technical solutions, they’re also a message to employees and customers that security is a priority.
