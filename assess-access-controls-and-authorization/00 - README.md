# Assess Access Controls and Authorization

In this project, I reviewed an access control incident at a growing business where unauthorized payroll access was discovered. I analyzed the access logs, took notes on key details, identified authorization issues, and made recommendations to strengthen security practices. This exercise helped me think about how expired accounts and weak controls can leave organizations vulnerable. It also reminded me how simple improvements can prevent incidents like this.

## Scenario
You’re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business. Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager said they didn’t make a mistake, and the payment was stopped in time. The owner asked you to investigate what happened and recommend improvements.

You reviewed the access logs and found the following:
- The event took place on **10/03/23**  
- The user account involved was **Legal/Administrator**  
- The login came from IP **152.207.255.255**
