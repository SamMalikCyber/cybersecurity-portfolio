# Assess Access Controls and Authorization

## Notes
- Event date: **10/03/23**  
- User role: **Legal/Administrator**  
- IP address: **152.207.255.255**

## Issues Found
- **Robert Taylor Jr** was still listed as an administrator even though his contract ended in **2019**  
- His account remained active and had access to payroll systems in **2023**  

## Recommendations
1. Configure user accounts to expire automatically (e.g., 30 days for contractors)  
2. Limit contractor accounts to only the resources required for their role  
3. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all admin and payroll accounts
