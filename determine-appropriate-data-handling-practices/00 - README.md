# Determine Appropriate Data Handling Practices

In this project I reviewed the results of a data risk assessment and evaluated whether proper data handling practices were in place to protect sensitive information. I analyzed the factors that led to an incident, summarized NIST SP 800-53 AC-6, and recommended controls to strengthen least privilege at the company. This was a solid amount of work and a good challenge, but I enjoyed it and it was engaging working through it even though in the bigger picture it wasnâ€™t overly complex.


## Scenario
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation discovered that an employee accidentally shared these confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

The supervisor provided you with details showing that the principle of least privilege was not followed during a sales meeting. Your task was to evaluate the incident, review current controls, recommend improvements, and justify how your recommendations would prevent similar leaks in the future.
