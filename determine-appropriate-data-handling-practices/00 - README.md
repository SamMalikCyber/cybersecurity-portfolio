# Determine Appropriate Data Handling Practices

In this project, I reviewed a real-world style data leak scenario and evaluated how the principle of least privilege could have prevented it. I examined the incident’s root causes, summarized NIST SP 800-53 AC-6, and made targeted recommendations to strengthen least privilege and improve my company's data handling. This was a hands-on exercise in thinking like a security analyst, identifying gaps in access controls, auditing practices, and link-sharing policies, then proposing realistic solutions to prevent future incidents. It was a solid amount of work that was both engaging and challenging, and I enjoyed working through it even though, in the bigger picture, it wasn’t overly complex.

## Scenario
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation discovered that an employee accidentally shared these confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

The supervisor provided you with details showing that the principle of least privilege was not followed during a sales meeting. Your task was to evaluate the incident, review current controls, recommend improvements, and justify how your recommendations would prevent similar leaks in the future.
